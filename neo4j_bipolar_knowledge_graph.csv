Patients with hyperthyroidism,usually exhibit,additional physical symptoms and signs.
Thyroid function testing,is advised,"for screening new patients, specifically T4 and TSH levels."
Patients with pheochromocytoma,typically present with,marked intermittent or sustained hypertension.
Absence of hypertension,suggests,that testing for pheochromocytoma is unnecessary.
Mania symptoms,are less commonly caused,by other disorders.
Depressive symptoms,may occur in,"various disorders, as listed in the table ""Some Causes of Symptoms of Depression and Mania."""
Mood stabilizers,are used in the treatment,"of bipolar disorder, such as lithium and certain antiseizure medications."
A second-generation antipsychotic,may be used in the treatment,of bipolar disorder.
Support and psychotherapy,are integral parts of,the treatment for bipolar disorder.
Treatment of bipolar disorder,is divided into,"three phases: Acute, Continuation, and Maintenance or prevention."
The Acute phase,aims to stabilize and control,the severe initial manifestations of bipolar disorder.

Selection of pharmacologic agents,should be based on,previous effectiveness and tolerability in the patient.
The choice,should consider,the patient's medical history if prior experience with medications for bipolar disorders is lacking or unknown.
The patient's medical history,should be evaluated,in relation to the adverse effects of the specific mood stabilizer.
The severity of symptoms,should guide,the choice of pharmacologic agents for bipolar disorders when prior experience is absent.
Severe manic psychosis,compromises,immediate patient safety and management.
Urgent behavioral control,necessitates,a sedating second-generation antipsychotic for severe manic psychosis.
A benzodiazepine,may initially supplement,"the antipsychotic for severe manic psychosis, like lorazepam or clonazepam."
Reference for benzodiazepine supplementation,can be found,"in the table titled ""Benzodiazepines""."
Lithium,is a suitable first choice for treating,less severe acute episodes of both mania and depressive episodes in patients without contraindications such as renal disorders.
Lithium,has,"a slow onset of action, taking 4 to 10 days to take effect."

A change in mood stabilizer type or dosing,may be necessary,if nonadherence to treatment for bipolar I disorder is an issue.
Lithium,reduces,the severity of bipolar mood swings.
Lithium,does not impact,normal mood.
Patients with a family history of typical bipolar disorders,have,a higher response rate to lithium.
Breakthroughs in mood stabilization,are more likely,with patients experiencing mixed states.
Patients with rapid-cycling forms of bipolar disorder,are more prone,to breakthroughs.
Rapid-cycling bipolar disorder,is typically defined as,four or more episodes per year.
Comorbid anxiety,increases the likelihood of,breakthroughs in mood stabilization treatment.
Substance use disorder,is associated with,a higher likelihood of breakthroughs in mood stabilization.
The presence of a neurologic disorder,can lead to,"more frequent breakthroughs in mood stabilization, regardless of the medication used."
Lithium carbonate dosage,is adjusted according to,"blood levels, tolerance, and response."
Higher maintenance levels of lithium carbonate,offer,more protection against manic episodes.
Higher maintenance levels of lithium carbonate,do not protect against,depressive episodes.
Higher maintenance levels of lithium carbonate,are associated with,more adverse effects.
Adolescents,require,higher doses of lithium carbonate due to excellent glomerular function.

Acute manic psychosis,is managed with,second-generation antipsychotics.
Second-generation antipsychotics,include,"Aripiprazole, Cariprazine, Lurasidone, Olanzapine, Quetiapine, Risperidone, and Ziprasidone."
Some second-generation antipsychotics,may enhance,the effects of mood stabilizers after the acute phase.
Medications,may cause,extrapyramidal adverse effects and akathisia.
Quetiapine and olanzapine,have,a lower risk of these effects due to their sedating nature.
Adverse effects,can include,substantial weight gain and metabolic syndrome development.
Metabolic syndrome,encompasses,"weight gain, excess abdominal fat, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia."
"Lurasidone, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole",may have,a lower risk of these less immediate adverse effects.
